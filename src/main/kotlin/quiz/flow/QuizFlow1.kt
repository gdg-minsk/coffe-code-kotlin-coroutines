 * Write a program where you will try to complete the code by starting a coroutine. The coroutine will keep processing
 * three times with a delay of 0.1 seconds, and when the coroutines end, it will print the name of users
 * with a delay of 1 second. You have to make a suspending function named getFlow using Flow,
 * and this function will print the userâ€™s count.
 *
 * Output:
 * Coroutine Processing
 * Coroutine Processing
 * Coroutine Processing
 * User0
 * User1
 * User2
